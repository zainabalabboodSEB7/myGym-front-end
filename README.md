## 📝 Project Description

**MuGym** is a fitness management web application where users can explore different gym categories, join training sessions, and interact with instructors.  
Each category includes multiple sessions, and signed-in users can leave reviews on sessions they attended.  
We built MuGym to provide a collaborative, community-driven fitness and training experience.

This project was developed as part of a **MERN Stack full-stack development requirement**:

- **Frontend:** React for a dynamic, interactive UI.  
- **Backend:** FastAPI for server-side functionality and RESTful APIs.  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL for relational data storage and management.  
- **Authentication & Authorization:** Implemented on both frontend and backend using JWT.  
- **CRUD Operations:** Full create, read, update, and delete functionality for users, categories, sessions, and reviews.  
- **Planning:** Created ERD, user stories, and wireframes before development.
